**Tutorial**

The topic of my Inverted Classroom presentation is Grab Objects With Hands In VR. Therefore I was given a tutorial by Dilmer Valecillos.

**Implementation**


**Problems**

After trying to follow Dilmer's steps in the tutorial, I noticed that he did't talk about a few neccessary steps from the beginning. Because this video is part of a whole Oculus Interaction SDK series, I knew I had to see the other videos which have been published before. 

Afterwards I still had some struggles. Although the video was released less than a year ago and regardless of using the same SDK as he did, the Oculus Interaction SDK, which is deprecated since October 2023, many concepts he was talking about did not exist in the same way anymore. Moreover in my version, different problems occured, like new mandatory fields, that where not much documented, wherefore I had many struggles to make the implementation work out on the Quest in the first place.

**Solution**

To overcome my problems I took other tutorials into account. Therefore I chose videos by Valem tutorials because I was able to easily follow the steps he showed.

**Integration in the big project**

When I chose this topic for the Inverted Classroom, I had not yet finalized my idea for the Locomotion technique and ways of interaction in the parkour. 

I chose to use the controllers due to the physical component and I need the possibility to use different buttons for different actions. Therefore I will not be able to use grabbing with my hands in VR. 

Nethertheless, I feel like this technique is very versital and can be used in many different usecases in VR, just sadly not in mine.

**Conclusion**

In the end, I felt like the implementation of the general idea was not that hard. Nevertheless, for somebody with little experience in Unity it was hard to follow the tutorial.
