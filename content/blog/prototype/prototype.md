In order to do so I watched different tutorials about bow and arrows in VR in Unity, for example the tutorial series of [Sunny Valley Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1jLkra5DRU "Sunny Valley Studio").

I got my low poly bow and arrow models from the Unity Asset Store for free from [Tuffpolygon](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/low-poly-medieval-weapons-melee-ranged-208981 "Tuffpolygon"). I removed the string from the model in Blender, in order to make a stretchable one in Unity.

At first I added the bow model to the scene and made it grabbable.
With the help of the LineRenderer Component i added a string to the bow in order to stretch it and shoot the arrow.
