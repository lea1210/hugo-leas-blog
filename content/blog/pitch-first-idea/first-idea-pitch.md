**First ideas**

Before presenting the first pitch of my idea, I had to think about one that I felt like I am able to implement as a beginner in Unity, but at the same time a idea that I feel like would be fun to play around with.

I liked the idea of including a physical component because it makes the whole experience much more immersive and natural for the user.

For getting more creative I was talking to a friend from my bachelor's degree who had some experiences with implementing Unity applications. I was telling him about my inspirations and ideas and we were talking about the practicability of my first suggestions.


**Inspiration**

Because I knew I wanted to add a physical component, I especially thought about Wii Games from Nintendo I knew from my childhood. They had, besides the controller, often a physical component included, like a steering wheel to add to your controller or the so called "Nunchucks" for using both hands.

In the game Wii Sports you were able to use the nunchuck to aim with a bow and shoot an arrow to a target. I am not sure if you really hat to pull the nunchuck back to draw the bow, but nonetheless I remember doing it because it felt natural to do so.

**Final idea**

Based on the Wii Sports game inspiration, I want to implement a bow and arrow to use for Locomotion and interaction. Therefore I want to build a prototype physical bow that the user can hold in order to feel like holding an actual bow. Concerning to that I want to add the controllers to this built bow.

***Locomotion idea***

When it comes to Locomotion, I want to use the bow to aim at large trees I plan to add to the parkour. In addition to that, I want to add a rope to the arrow and the other end to the player, so when I aim at a tree, I will be able to swing forward.

***Interaction idea***

In order to implement different interactions with objects
